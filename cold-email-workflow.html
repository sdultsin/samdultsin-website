          <p>
            When I started doing outreach, I didn't want to rely on templates or
            "growth hacks." I wanted to build something that actually converted,
            then systemize it so it could run automatically without losing the
            human touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page breaks down exactly how I built it: the tools, the logic,
            and the thought process behind the campaign that landed in your
            inbox.

            <h2>Setting the Foundation</h2>
            <p>
              Before writing a single email, I built the website you're on right
              now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from branding, it fits more than a resume ever could and
              does so in an interactive way. It shows how I think, build, and
              solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned vibe coding with Claude and YouTube tutorials, practiced
              with a mock AI SaaS site, and then built this one in a week using
              VS Code, Claude, GitHub, and Vercel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the site was live, the next step was directing the right kind
              of traffic to it.
            </p>

        <!-- Defining Who to Reach -->
        <h2>Defining Who to Reach</h2>
        <p>The system only works if you know exactly who you're talking to.</p>
        <p>
          To define that precisely, I used Perplexity to shape an ideal customer
          profile (ICP) across both of my service areas: AI evaluation and
          growth automation. As for accounts, I built a scoring model that ranks
          companies by relevance.
        </p>

        <div class="scoring-section">
          <div class="scoring-text">
            <p>Each company got a weighted score based on:</p>
            <ul class="workflow-list">
              <li>Total and latest funding</li>
              <li>Funding recency</li>
              <li>Team size</li>
              <li>Industry relevance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I prioritized funding recency because newer rounds usually mean
              they're in the middle of a growth sprint, which is the perfect
              time for outbound optimization.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="scoring-image">

              src="images/funding_recency_score.png"
              alt="Funding recency scoring breakdown"

            <!-- Description below the image -->
            <p class="formula-caption">
              Companies are scored by how recently they raised funding, with the
              most recent rounds (0-6 months) earning the highest score of 35
              points.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          After running about 1,000 accounts through the system, I had a ranked
          list with the most promising companies at the top.
        </p>

        <!-- Lead Research & Enrichment -->
        <div class="enrichment-section">
          <h2>Lead Research & Enrichment</h2>
          <p>
            Finding leads was straightforward. After ranking the accounts, I
            filtered by role (e.g., for growth outreach, I targeted CTOs and
            Heads of Product or Engineering).
          </p>
          <p>
            But I didn't want the emails to sound automated. Each message had to
            feel like it was written by someone who actually did their homework.
            Doing that manually for thousands of leads isn't sustainable, so
            this is where automation came in.
          </p>
          <p>
            To scale the human touch, I built an
            <strong>automated lead enrichment system</strong> powered by
            Perplexity's API and a few custom Apps Scripts. It personalizes each
            email in three steps.

        <h3>Step 1: Research</h3>
        <div class="step-container">
          <div class="step-card">
            <p>
              For each lead in the sheet, the system runs a Perplexity prompt
              that pulls company context from both structured data (employee
              count, funding info, company website, LinkedIn) and online search.
              It finds one notable product, feature, or update to reference in
              the email.
            </p>

            <p class="example-label">Example output:</p>
            <p class="example-output">
              <em
                >&quot;Noticed you recently raised $2.5 million to automate sales knowledge. Curious about your approach to scaling outbound and managing email infrastructure as you grow your sales team.&quot;</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              At first, I tried using a single prompt to handle everything, but
              the results were too generic. Breaking it into three API calls
              gave the process cleaner logic and better context.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step-image">
            <img
              src="images/research_prompt_colored.png"
              alt="Research prompt formula"
            />
            <p class="image-caption">
              *The full prompt includes additional formatting rules and output
              constraints not shown in this snippet.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 2: Pain Points -->
        <h3>Step 2: Pain Points</h3>
        <div class="step-card">
          <p>
            The second API call builds on the first output. It identifies one or
            two likely pain points based on their product, growth stage, or
            recent activity, then crafts a short follow-up sentence that
            connects those insights.
          </p>

          <p class="example-label">Example output:</p>
          <p class="example-output">
            <em
              >&quot;Getting reps to actually use your knowledge tool in their cold emails probably beats building the tool itself. Most teams still just copy paste generic templates anyway.&quot;</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3: Subject Line -->
        <h3>Step 3: Subject Line</h3>
        <div class="step-card">
          <p>
            The final API call generates a subject line that feels natural and
            contextual, not like typical sales clickbait. It uses the previous
            two outputs for context.
          </p>

          <p class="example-label">Example:</p>
          <p class="example-output">
            <em>&quot;$2.5M raise + scaling outbound&quot;</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            In total, each email ends up with three to four personalized
            sentences that read like I actually researched them (because I did,
            just automated).
