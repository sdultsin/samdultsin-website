                <p>When I started doing outreach, I didn't want to rely on templates or "growth hacks."</p>
                <p>I wanted to build something that actually converted, then systemize it so it could run automatically without losing the human touch.</p>
                <p>This page breaks down exactly how I built it: the tools, the logic, and the thought process behind the campaign that landed in your inbox.</p>

        <h2>Setting the Foundation</h2>
        <p>Before writing a single email, I built the website you're on right now.</p>
        <p>Aside from branding, it fits more than a resume ever could and does so in an interactive way. It shows how I think, build, and solve problems.</p>
        <p>I learned vibe coding with Claude and YouTube tutorials, practiced with a mock AI SaaS site, and then built this one in a week using VS Code, Claude, GitHub, and Vercel.</p>
        <p>Once the site was live, the next step was directing the right kind of traffic to it.</p>

            <h2>Defining Who to Reach</h2>
            <p>The system only works if you know exactly who you're talking to.</p>
            <p>I wanted founders and technical leads: people building real products, not agencies or freelancers.</p>
            <p>To define that precisely, I used Perplexity to shape an ideal customer profile (ICP) across both of my service areas: AI evaluation and growth automation. From there, I built a scoring model that ranks companies by relevance.</p>
            <p>Each company got a weighted score based on:</p>
            <ul class="workflow-list">
                <li>Total and latest funding</li>
                <li>Funding recency</li>
                <li>Team size</li>
                <li>Industry relevance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I prioritized funding recency because newer rounds usually mean they're in the middle of a growth sprint, which is the perfect time for outbound optimization.</p>
            <p>After running about 1,000 accounts through the system, I had a ranked list of targets with the most promising companies at the top.</p>
