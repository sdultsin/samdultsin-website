          <p>
            When I started doing outreach, I wanted to avoid generic emails altogether. I wanted to build something that actually converted,
            then systemize it so it could run automatically without losing the
            human touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>This page breaks down exactly how I built it:</strong> the tools, the logic,
            and the thought process behind the campaign that landed in your
            inbox.

            <h2>Setting the Foundation</h2>
            <p>
              Before writing a single email, I built the website you're on right
              now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from branding, it fits more than a resume ever could and
              does so in an interactive way. It shows how I think, build, and
              solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned vibe coding with Claude and YouTube tutorials, practiced
              with a mock AI SaaS site, and then built this one in a week using
              VS Code, Claude, GitHub, and Vercel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the site was live, the next step was directing the right kind
              of traffic to it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="growth-image-half">

        <!-- Defining Who to Reach -->
        <h2>Defining Who to Reach</h2>
        <p>The system only works if you target the right people.</p>
        <p>
          To define that precisely, I used Perplexity to shape an ideal customer
          profile across both of my service areas: AI evaluation and
          growth automation. As for accounts, I built a scoring model that ranks
          companies by relevance.
        </p>

        <div class="scoring-section">
          <div class="scoring-text">
            <p>Each company got a weighted score based on:</p>
            <ul class="workflow-list">
              <li>Total and latest funding</li>
              <li>Funding recency</li>
              <li>Team size</li>
              <li>Industry relevance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              I prioritized funding recency because newer rounds usually mean
              they're in the middle of a growth sprint, which is the perfect
              time for outbound optimization.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="scoring-image">

              src="images/funding_recency_score.png"
              alt="Funding recency scoring breakdown"
            />

            <!-- Description below the image -->
            <p class="formula-caption">
              Companies are scored by how recently they raised funding, with the
              most recent rounds (0-6 months) earning the highest score of 35

            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          After running about 1,000 accounts through the system, I had a ranked
          list with the most promising companies at the top.
        </p>

        <!-- Scoring Sheet Image -->

        <!-- Lead Research & Enrichment -->
        <div class="enrichment-section">
          <h2>Lead Research & Enrichment</h2>
          <p>
            Finding leads was straightforward. After ranking the accounts, I
            filtered by role (e.g., for growth outreach, CTOs and
            Heads of Product or Engineering).
          </p>
          <p>
            But I didn't want the emails to sound automated. Each message had to
            feel like it was written by someone who actually did their homework.
            Doing that manually for thousands of leads isn't sustainable, so
            this is where automation came in.
          </p>
          <p>
            To scale the human touch, I built an
            <strong>automated lead enrichment system</strong> powered by
            Perplexity's API and a few custom Apps Scripts. It personalizes each
            email in three steps.

        <div class="step-container">
          <div class="step-card">
            <p>
              For each lead in the sheet, the system runs a Perplexity prompt
              that pulls company context from both structured data (employee
              count, funding info, company website, LinkedIn) and online search.
              It finds one notable product, feature, or update to reference in
              the email.
            </p>

            <p class="example-label">Example output:</p>
            <p class="example-output">
              <em
                >&quot;Saw [Company] added multi-agent AI for policy assessments. How are you testing
agent accuracy and coordination in complex GRC tasks?&quot;</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              At first, I tried using a single prompt to handle everything, but
              the results were too generic. Breaking it into three API calls
              gave the process cleaner logic and better context.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step-image">

            <p class="image-caption">
              *The full prompt includes additional formatting rules and output

        <!-- Step 2: Pain Points -->
        <h3>Step 2: Pain Points</h3>
        <div class="step-card">
          <p>
            The second API call builds on the first output. It identifies one or
            two likely pain points based on their product, growth stage, or
            recent activity, then crafts a short follow-up sentence that
            connects those insights.
          </p>

          <p class="example-label">Example output:</p>
          <p class="example-output">
            <em
              >&quot;Testing [Company's] agent coordination gets tricky with complex policy dependencies.

          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3: Subject Line -->
        <h3>Step 3: Subject Line</h3>
        <div class="step-card">
          <p>
            The final API call generates a subject line that feels natural and
            contextual, not like typical sales clickbait. It uses the previous
            two outputs for context.
          </p>

          <p class="example-label">Example:</p>
          <p class="example-output">
            <em>&quot;[Company's] agent coordination + policy QA&quot;</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            In total, each email ends up with three to four personalized
            sentences that read like I actually researched them (because I did,
            just automated).

<!-- Evaluating Perplexity API Outputs -->

            <p>
              All three Perplexity functions went through 10+ testing rounds with pattern analysis, prompt refinement, and quality benchmarking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early versions produced generic outputs or hallucinated company details, but iteration (testing 5 companies per round, identifying error patterns, fixing root causes) brought accuracy rates from 17% to 92%.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final prompts include gold standard examples, domain-specific rules, and fallback logic to handle edge cases like name collisions or missing signals.

        <!-- Testing and Iteration -->
        <h2>Email Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          While building this whole campaign, I was warming up two domains (one for growth outreach and one for AI eval) using Instantly.ai. Each domain runs separate campaigns so I can isolate metrics later.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once live, I started testing one variable at a time: subject lines,
          openers, CTAs, and signatures. Every test inside
          Instantly produces data that feeds into the next iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This workflow keeps evolving as I learn more. Each test makes the next
          one better.
        </p>

        <!-- Why This Matters -->
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Most people think cold email is just about copywriting. It's not.</p>
          </p>
           <strong>Volume is heavily underestimated and personalization isn't
          something that needs to be sacrificed when scaling outreach.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This system proves that. It:</p>
        <ul class="workflow-list">
          <li>
            finds the right companies, scores them intelligently, and writes
            contextually relevant messages in seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            runs on simple, low-cost tools that can fit into any startup's
            stack.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you got one of these emails, it wasn't random.</p>
        <p>It was the output of this process.</p>
